### Disclaimer
Stylesheet does not set the background colour of the editor window, internal PDF viewer background colour and internal PDF viewer highlight colour. For that, set it from within the TXS settings (or modify `texstudio.ini`).

## To Do:
- Colour of the "Reset buttons of GUI scaling in TXS Config menu"
